The app leverages AI to analyze and modify recipes, ensuring they match user-defined dietary profiles.

With a user-friendly interface, FoodFlex makes it easy for users to upload a recipe (via text, URL, or image) and receive a customized version that suits their specific needs. This tool is great for anyone with dietary restrictions and can be used by people looking to maintain specific nutritional goals.

## Use Case

1. **Scenario**: A user with gluten and dairy allergies finds a recipe for lasagna online but needs it modified. They upload the recipe URL into FoodFlex, and the app uses AI to swap out ingredients (e.g., replacing wheat-based pasta with gluten-free options, dairy cheese with vegan alternatives). The user can save this modified version, along with its nutritional breakdown, for future use or share it with friends.

2. **Scenario 2**: A user at the grocery store scans a bottle of sauce and asks the chatbot if it fits their dietary profile. If itâ€™s okay, the app stores that information for future purchases and checks.

## Requirements

### Back-end:
- **Django**: For user authentication, profile management, and API handling.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: For storing user profiles, recipe history, and ingredient data.
- **OpenAI API** or **Spoonacular API**: For recipe modification and AI-based ingredient replacement.
- **Edamam API** or **Nutritionix API**: For providing nutritional information about the modified recipes.
- **Tesseract (or any OCR API)**: For extracting text from uploaded recipe images.

### Front-end:
- **React.js** or **Next.js**: For building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For structured JavaScript development.
- **Streamlit**: For recipe visualization, step-by-step instructions, and nutritional breakdown.

### Other Technologies:
- **Cloudflare**: For DNS and security.
- **Databricks**: (Optional) For advanced AI model development, such as personalized dietary prediction based on historical data.
- **Twilio (Optional)**: For SMS or notification services, sending recipe recommendations.
